# Agent Guidelines

## Testing and Verification
All code changes must be tested and validated using the browser tool.
- **Cross-Device Testing**: You must verify your changes on both desktop web sizes and mobile web sizes.
- **Visual Verification**: Use command line tools or browser interactions to ensure the UI renders correctly across these dimensions.

## Design Guidelines
- **Legibility**: Ensure text is always legible. High contrast between text and background is required.
- **Color Palette**: Use complementary colors. Ensure that different color palettes do not negatively impact text readability.
- **Consistency**: Do not introduce too many varieties of text styling. Stick to the established design system and typography.

## Code Quality
- **Reusable Components**: Prioritize creating and using reusable components. Avoid duplicating code or styles; abstract common patterns into shared components.
