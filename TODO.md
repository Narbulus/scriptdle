### Features and Improvements

- Puzzle reset should happen at midnight each night
- Introduce UI to show how long until daily puzzles reset. This should be prominently displayed on the main page and on the completed puzzle page
- The home page needs to educate users on how to play / explain the gist of the game
- Main page movie / pack list overhaul:
  - More compact results
  - Puzzles that you've played recently should be hoisted to the top for easy access
- Create a privacy policy and terms of service page link from the footer on all pages
- Migrate results page to use the popout modal
- Overhaul the completed puzzle page
  - Prominently display your new flower, your current streak, when the next puzzle will be available
  - Make success feel more celebratory
- The link to the IMDB movie card on the games page is not obvious enough, we should explore how to make it more obvious without cluttering the footer

### Bugs

- [x] If the movie dropdown selector has a long title, the downward caret on the character selector is misaligned
- [x] The 'More Movies' text is faded and the styling doesn't match that of the attempts text next to it
