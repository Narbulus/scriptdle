So he says \"How would you like to be rich?\" So I said \"Sure.\" So he lays this book on me. He says this book will tell me the outcome of every sporting event till the end of the century. All I have to do is bet on the winner, and I'll never lose. So I said \"What's the catch?\" He says, \"No catch. Just keep it a secret.\" After that, he disappeared. I never saw him again. Oh, and he told me one more thing. He said, \"Someday a crazy, wild-eyed scientist, or a kid may show up askin' about that book. And if that ever happens...\" Funny. I never thought it would be you."
