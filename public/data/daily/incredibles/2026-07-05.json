It is not unknown for Supers to have more than one power when young but this little one has many. Yes, you have many powers! I understand your lack of sleep and coherency, Robert. Babies can be anything, and your child is no exception. He has pure, unlimited potential, Robert. He slept while I worked in a creative fever. Auntie Edna stayed up all night making sure you look fabulous in your many forms."
