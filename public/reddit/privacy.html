    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Scriptle ("the App") is a movie quote guessing game available on Reddit via the Devvit platform. We are committed to being transparent about how data is handled.</p>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.</strong> All data flows through and is stored exclusively on Reddit's infrastructure:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Game progress, scores, streaks, and settings are stored in Reddit's Redis service via the Devvit platform.</li>
      <li>Your Reddit user ID is used only to associate your game progress within the Reddit platform. This data never leaves Reddit's systems.</li>
      <li>Community stats (guess distributions) are stored in aggregate form on Reddit's infrastructure. No individual gameplay data is shared publicly — only anonymized totals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>To be explicit, we do <strong>not</strong> collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Names, email addresses, or contact information</li>
      <li>Location data</li>
      <li>Device identifiers</li>
      <li>Cookies or tracking pixels</li>
      <li>Any data from other apps or services</li>
      <li>Any data for advertising or marketing purposes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not use analytics trackers or any third-party data collection services.</p>

    <h2>Shared Results</h2>
    <p>When you share your game results as a comment, that comment is posted through Reddit's standard API and is subject to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy">Reddit's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App runs entirely within Reddit's Devvit platform. Reddit's own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/policies/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a> governs all data handled by their infrastructure. We do not integrate with any other third-party services.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Scriptle does not knowingly collect any personal information from anyone, including children under 13. The App is subject to Reddit's own age requirements and terms.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected by the "Last updated" date at the top of this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this privacy policy, you can reach us via the app's support channels on Reddit or by opening an issue on the project's GitHub repository.</p>
