    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Scriptle for Reddit &middot; Last updated: February 12, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By using Scriptle ("the App") on Reddit, you agree to these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the App.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Scriptle is a free, daily movie quote guessing game that runs on Reddit via the Devvit platform. It is provided as-is for entertainment purposes.</p>

    <h2>3. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>You agree to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for its intended purpose — playing the movie quote guessing game</li>
      <li>Not attempt to manipulate game results, stats, or leaderboards</li>
      <li>Not interfere with or disrupt the App's functionality</li>
      <li>Not use automated tools or bots to interact with the App</li>
      <li>Follow Reddit's <a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy">Content Policy</a> when using the App</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Intellectual Property &amp; Fair Use</h2>
    <p>The Scriptle game concept, design, and code are the property of the App's developers.</p>
    <p>The App displays brief, isolated snippets of dialogue from copyrighted motion picture screenplays. These snippets are used under the fair use doctrine (17 U.S.C. &sect; 107) based on the following factors:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Purpose and character of use.</strong> The App is a transformative, non-commercial, interactive trivia game. The dialogue excerpts are not presented for their original expressive or narrative purpose but are repurposed as clues in a guessing game — a fundamentally different use from the original works.</li>
      <li><strong>Nature of the copyrighted works.</strong> The source works are published, commercially distributed motion pictures that have been widely available to the public.</li>
      <li><strong>Amount and substantiality of the portion used.</strong> Each puzzle displays only a small number of individual dialogue lines from a given screenplay — a quantitatively and qualitatively minimal portion of the overall work. No plot summaries, scene descriptions, stage directions, or narrative structure are reproduced.</li>
      <li><strong>Effect on the market.</strong> The App does not serve as a substitute for the original motion pictures or their screenplays, nor does it diminish the market for or value of those works. Brief, decontextualized dialogue fragments displayed in a game cannot replace the experience of viewing the films or reading the scripts. If anything, the App promotes continued interest in the underlying works.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All movie titles, character names, and dialogue remain the property of their respective copyright holders. The App does not claim any ownership of or affiliation with those works. If a rights holder believes any content used in the App exceeds the scope of fair use, they may contact us using the information below and we will promptly address the concern.</p>

    <h2>5. User-Generated Content</h2>
    <p>When you share game results as comments on Reddit, those comments are subject to Reddit's Terms of Service and Content Policy. We do not claim ownership of your comments.</p>

    <h2>6. No Warranty</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind, express or implied. We do not guarantee:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Uninterrupted or error-free operation</li>
      <li>Accuracy of movie script data</li>
      <li>Availability of the service at any particular time</li>
      <li>Preservation of game progress, streaks, or collection data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the developers of Scriptle shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>8. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

    <h2>9. Subreddit Moderators</h2>
    <p>Moderators who install Scriptle on their subreddits are responsible for configuring the App appropriately for their community. The App's developers are not responsible for how individual subreddits choose to use or configure the App.</p>

    <h2>10. Third-Party Platforms</h2>
    <p>The App operates on Reddit's Devvit platform and is subject to Reddit's Developer Terms and Devvit's terms of service. Your use of Reddit is governed by Reddit's own terms and policies.</p>

    <h2>11. Contact</h2>
    <p>For questions about these terms, you can reach us via the app's support channels on Reddit or by opening an issue on the project's GitHub repository.</p>
