Get the Windex, do\na good job. Now Jimmie, we need to raid\nyour linen closet. I need blankets, I need\ncomforters, I need quilts, I need\nbedspreads. The thicker the better, the\ndarker the better. No whites, can't use\n'em. We need to camouflage the interior of\nthe car. We're gonna line the front seat\nand the backseat and the floor boards with\nquilts and blankets. If a cop stops us and\nstarts stickin' his big snout in the car,\nthe subterfuge won't last. But at a\nglance, the car will appear to be normal.\nJimmie \u2013 lead the way, boys \u2013 get to work."

Ezekiel\n25:17. \"The path of the righteous man is\nbeset on all sides by the inequities of\nthe selfish and the tyranny of evil men.\nBlessed is he who, in the name of charity\nand good will, shepherds the weak through\nthe valley of the darkness. For he is\ntruly his brother's keeper and the finder\nof lost children. And I will strike down\nupon thee with great vengeance and furious\nanger those who attempt to poison and\ndestroy my brothers. And you will know I\nam the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon\nyou.\"I been sayin' that shit for years.\nAnd if you ever heard it, it meant your\nass. I never really questioned what it\nmeant. I thought it was just a cold-\nblooded thing to say to a motherfucker\n'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I\nsaw some shit this mornin' made me think\ntwice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean\nyou're the evil man. And I'm the righteous\nman. And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd\nprotecting my righteous ass in the valley\nof darkness. Or is could by you're the\nrighteous man and I'm the shepherd and\nit's the world that's evil and selfish.\n(MORE)"
