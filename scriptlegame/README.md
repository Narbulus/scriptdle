# Scriptle - The Movie Quote Guessing Game

**Can you name the movie and character from a single line of dialogue?**

Scriptle is a daily puzzle game where you're given a quote from a movie script and try to guess the movie and character. New puzzles every day across 9 themed packs.

## How to Play

You're shown a mystery quote and have **5 attempts** to guess the **movie** and **character** who said it.

- **Guess right** and you're rewarded with confetti and a collectible badge.
- **Get one half right** (e.g. correct movie, wrong character) and it **locks in** — now you only need to figure out the other half.
- **Guess wrong** and the game progressively **reveals surrounding dialogue** from the script as clues. Lines shimmer in one at a time — first the text, then the speaker — giving you more context with each attempt.

By your final attempt you'll have the original quote plus surrounding lines with full speaker info to help you out.
