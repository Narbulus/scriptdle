<b>                                     FRODO

<b>                                     GANDALF
</b>                         I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder
                         of the Flame of Anor!
<b>
</b>                         [Camera pans closer to the mountain
                         side.]
<b>

                         Fire will not avail you, Flame of Ud\xfbn!
                         [Camera zooms in through the mountain
                         and focuses on Gandalf and the Balrog
                         on the bridge of Khazad-d\xfbm. The Balrog
                         strikes down on Gandalf with its flaming
                         sword. Gandalf parries the blow with
                         Glamdring, shattering the Balrog\x92s sword.]

</b><b>
</b>                         [Gandalf strikes his staff onto the
                         bridge. As the Balrog steps forward,
                         the bridge collapses from under it and
                         the demon plunges backward into the
                         chasm. Gandalf, exhausted, leans on
                         his staff and watches the Balrog fall
                         then turns to follow the others. At
                         the last minute, the flaming whip lashes
                         up from the depths of the abyss and
                         winds around Gandalf\x92s ankle, dragging
                         him over the edge. He clings onto the
                         bridge but is straining to keep his
                         grip.]

                         [Frodo rushes forward but Boromir restrains
                         him.]

<b>
</b>                         [Gandalf falls after the Balrog and
                         grabs hold of his sword Glamdring on
                         his way down. As they continue to plunge
                         into the depths, Gandalf hacks away
                         at the Balrog even as it thrashes and
                         bounces off the walls. They continue
                         to plunge at great speed, sometimes
                         with Gandalf clinging to the horn of
                         the demon. The battling pair then falls
                         into an enormous cavern and plunges
                         into the water. Just then Frodo awakens
                         as if from a nightmare.]

                         terrain Emyn Muil. They look into the

                         It\x92s just where we can\x92t get. Let\x92s
                         face it, Mr. Frodo, we\x92re lost. I don\x92t

                         Ring by his chest and sits down, still
                         panting. He then fumbles for his water
                         bottle and takes a sip.]

                         appears on top of the cliff. The creature
                         Gollum has appeared and is making his
                         way down to the hobbits.]

                         up, grab hold of Gollum\x92s arms and pull
                         him down. Amidst the struggle, Gollum
                         wriggles loose and leaps onto Frodo.
                         As Frodo falls back, the chain and Ring
                         around his neck is revealed and Gollum
                         jumps straight for the Ring. Sam tries
                         to grab at him but is knocked away.
                         Gollum now jumps on top of Frodo and
                         tries to reach for the Ring even as
                         Frodo grabs his hands and tries to push
                         him away. Gollum\x92s cheeks puff with
                         exertion as he struggles with Frodo,
                         his enormous eyes fixed on the Ring.
                         Sam grabs hold of Gollum again and tears
                         him away from Frodo. Gollum then turns
                         around and bites Sam on the shoulder,
                         wriggles around and clasps his arms
                         around Sam\x92s neck and legs around his
                         waist in a death grip. Frodo unsheathes
                         Sting and holds it to Gollum's throat.]
