<PRE>
Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world,
<P>I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow airport.
<P>General opinion makes out that we live in a world of hatred and greed
<P>I don't see that.
<P>Seems to me that love is everywhere.
<P>Often it's not particularly dignified or newsworthy but it's always there.
<P>Fathers and sons, mothers and daughters, husbands and wives,
<P>boyfriends, girlfriends, old friends.
<P>When the planes hit the Twin Towers,
<P>none of the phone calls from people on board were messages of hate or revenge,
<P>hey were all messages of love.
<P>lf you look for it, I've got a sneaky feeling you'll find that love actually is all around.'
<P>LOVE    ACTUALLY
<P>"I feel it in my fingers

<P>"I feel it in my toes
<P>"Feel it in my toes, yeah
<P>"Love is all around me And so the..."
<P>- I'm afraid you did it again, Bill.
<P> It's just I know the old version so well, you know.
<P>Well, we all do.
<P>That's why we're making the new version.
<P>Right, OK, let's go.
<P>"I feel it in my fingers "In my fingers
<P>"I feel it in my toes
<P>"Feel it in my toes, yeah
<P>"Love is all ar..."
<P>Oh, fuck, wank, bugger, shitting arsehead and hole.
<P>Start again.
<P>"I feel it in my fingers "In my fingers
<P>"I feel it in my toes

<P>"Feel it in my toes, yeah
<P>"Christmas is all around me "All around me
<P>"And so the feeling grows
<P>"So the feeling grows
<P>"It's written in the wind "In the wind
<P>"It's everywhere I go
<P>"Everywhere I go
<P>"So if you really love Christmas "Love Christmas
<P>"Come on and let it snow
<P>"Come on and let it..."
<P>This is shit, isn't it?
<P>Yep, solid gold shit, maestro.
<P>- God, I'm so late. - It's just round the corner, you'll make it.
<P>You sure you don't mind me going without you?
<P>No, really. I'm just feeling so rotten.
<P>- I love you. - I know.
<P>I love you even when you're sick and look disgusting.

<P>I know. Now, go or you will actually miss it.
<P>Right.
<P>- Did I mention that I love you? - Yes, you did. Get out, loser.
<P>Karen, it's me again.
<P>I'm sorry, I literally don't have anybody else to talk to.
<P>Absolutely. Horrible moment, though. Can I call you back?
<P>Of course.
<P>Doesn't mean I'm not terribly concerned that your wife just died.
<P>Understood.
<P>Er, bugger off, call me later.
<P>So what's this big news?
<P>We've been given our parts in the nativity play
<P>and I'm the lobster.
<P>- The lobster? - Yeah.
<P>- In the nativity play? - Yeah. First Lobster.
<P>There was more than one lobster present at the birth of Jesus?
<P>Duh.

<P>Best sandwiches in Britain.
<P>Try my lovely nuts?
<P>Beautiful muffin for a beautiful lady.
<P>Morning, my future wife.
<P> OK, you can stop there. Thanks.
<P> I need a couple of orange gels.
<P>By the way, he introduced me as John but everyone calls me Jack.
<P>Oh, fine. Nice to meet you, Jack.
<P>He got me right, though. I'm just Judy.
<P>Great, Just Judy!
<P>- No surprises? - No surprises.
<P>- Not like the stag night? - Unlike the stag night.
<P>- You admit the prostitutes were a mistake? - I do.
<P>And it would've been much better if they'd not turned out to be men?
<P>That is true.

<P>Good luck, kiddo.
<P> Prime Minister, over here!
<P>Thank you.
<P>- Welcome, Prime Minister. - Woh! I must work on my wave.
<P>How are you?
<P>- How are you feeling? - Erm...
<P>Cool. Powerful.
<P>Would you like to meet your household staff?
<P>Yes, I would like that very much indeed.
<P>Anything to put off actually running the country.
<P>- This is Terence. He's in charge. - Morning, sir.
<P>Good morning. I had an uncle called Terence.
<P>Hated him, I think he was a pervert. But I very much like the look of you.
<P>- This is Pat. - Hello, Pat.
<P>Good morning, sir. I'm the housekeeper.
<P>Oh, right. I should be easier than the last lot.

<P>No nappies, no teenagers, no scary wife.
<P>And this is Natalie. She's new, like you.
<P>- Hello, Natalie. - Hello, David. I mean, sir.
<P>Shit, I can't believe I've just said that.
<P>And now I've gone and said "shit". Twice. I'm so sorry, sir.
<P>You could've said "fuck" and we'd have been in real trouble.
<P>Thank you, sir. I had a premonition I was gonna fuck up on my first day.
<P>Oh, piss it!
<P>Right, I'll get my things and then let's fix the country, shall we?
<P>Yeah, I can't see why not.
<P>- It's all right. - Did you see what I did?
<P>- Yes, I did. - I just went "blurh".
<P>- Hello there. - I'm right over here.
<P>Yeah, I'm in here. OK. Good. Thank you.
<P>Ah.
<P>Oh, no.
<P>That is so inconvenient.

<P>In the presence of God, Peter and Juliet have given their consent
<P>and made their marriage vows to each other.
<P>They've declared their marriage by the giving of rings.
<P>I therefore proclaim that they are husband and wife.
<P>And you resisted the temptation for surprises.
<P>Yeah, I'm mature now.
<P> " Love, love, love
<P>"Love, love, love
<P>- "Love, love, love..." - Did you do this?
<P>Er, no.
<P>"Love, love, love, love
<P>"There's nothing you can do that can't be done"
<P>Oh, it...
<P>"There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung
<P>"There's nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
<P>"It's easy

<P>"All you need is love
<P>"All you need is love
<P>"All you need is love, love
<P>"Love is all you need..."
<P>Look, it's Pikey.
<P>Hello! What the hell are you doing here?
<P>Oh, I just popped over to borrow some old CDs.
<P>- The lady of the house let you in, did she? - Yeah.
<P>- Lovely, obliging girl. - Yeah.
<P>I thought I'd pop back and see if she's better. This is good.
<P>- Oh. - Listen, erm, I've been thinking.
<P>I think we ought to take Mum out for her birthday on Friday. What do you think?
<P>- I just feel we've been bad sons this year. - Sounds fine. A bit boring but fine.
<P> Hurry up, big boy!
<P>I'm naked and I want you at least twice before Jamie gets home.
<P> I am so happy to see you!

<P>- Delicious delicacy? - Er, no, thanks.
<P>Taste explosion?
<P>- Food? - No, thanks.
<P>Yeah, a bit dodgy, isn't it?
<P>Looks like a dead baby's finger. Oooh.
<P>Oh. Tastes like it, too.
<P>I'm Colin, by the way.
<P>- I'm Nancy. - Wicked.
<P>- What do you do, Nancy? - I'm a cook.
<P>- Ever do weddings? - Yes, I do.
<P>- They should've asked you to do this one. - They did.
<P>- God, I wish you hadn't have turned it down. - I didn't.
<P> Right.
<P>- I've worked out why I can't find true love. - Why is that?
<P>English girls. They're stuck up, you see.
<P>And I am primarily attractive to girls who are cooler, game for a laugh.

<P>Like American girls. So I should just go to America!
<P>I'd get a girlfriend there instantly. What do you think?
<P>I think it's crap, Colin.
<P>That's where you're wrong.
<P>American girls would dig me with my cute British accent.
<P>- You don't have a cute British accent. - Yes, I do! I'm going to America.
<P>Colin, you're a Ionely, ugly arsehole. Accept it.
<P>Never. I am Colin, God of Sex. I'm just on the wrong continent, that's all.
<P>Bit of quiet while we finish the lighting, guys!
<P>- The traffic today was just... - Unbelievable.
<P>Judy, could you take the top off this time?
<P>Lighting need to know when we're gonna see the, erm, nipples and when we're not.
<P>Yes, OK. Right. At least it's nice and warm in here.
<P>Not always the case, is it?
<P>I was standing in for Brad Pitt once on Seven Years In Tibet...
<P>- Yes, yeah. - Bloody freezing...
<P>Guys, time's tight and we have to get the actors in.

<P>- Fine. - I promise I won't look.
<P> Right, let's have another look at that, please.
<P>Can you just put your hands on her breasts?
<P>- OK, yeah. Is that all right? - Yes.
<P>I'll warm them up!
<P>- And massage them, please. - Right.
<P>It's junction 13 that's just murder, isn't it? Total gridlock this morning.
<P>Jo and I had a lot of time to prepare for this moment.
<P>Some of her requests,
<P>for instance, that I should bring Claudia Schiffer as my date to the funeral,
<P>I was confident she expected me to ignore.
<P>But others she was pretty damn clear about.
<P>When she first mentioned what's about to happen,
<P>I said, "Over my dead body."
<P>And she said, "No, Daniel, over mine."
<P>And as usual, my darling girl...

<P>and Sam's darling mum was right.
<P>So she's going to say her final farewell to you not through me but,
<P>inevitably,
<P>ever so coolly,
<P>through the immortal genius of the Bay City Rollers.
<P>"Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
<P>"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye
<P>"Bye bye baby
<P>"Don't make me cry "Goodbye baby, baby bye bye
<P>"You're the one girl in town I'd marry
<P>"Girl I'd marry you now if I were free
<P>"I wish it could be
<P>"I could love you but why begin it?
<P>"Cos there ain't any future in it
<P>"She's got me but I'm not free so..."
<P>"Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
<P>"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye

<P>"Bye bye baby, don't make me cry
<P>"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye
<P>"Wish I never had known you..."
<P>Do you love him?
<P>Er, er, what?
<P>No, l-I just thought I'd ask bluntly in case it was the right question
<P>and you needed someone to talk to about it and no one had ever asked you.
<P>No. No. No is the answer. Absolutely not.
<P>"...on my finger..."
<P>So that's a no, then?
<P>Yes. Erm...
<P>"Bye bye baby, baby goodbye
<P>"Goodbye baby, baby bye bye..."
<P>This DJ, what do you reckon?
<P>- The worst in history? - Probably.
<P>I think it all hangs on the next song.
<P>Now here's one for the lovers.

<P>That's quite a few of you, I shouldn't be surprised and a half.
<P>"And they called it..."
<P>- He's done it, it's official. - Worst DJ in the world.
<P>"Oh, I guess they'll never know..."
<P>Sarah's waiting for you.
<P>Oh, yes, of course, erm...
<P>Great, er, good, good.
<P>How are you doing, Mia? Settling in fine? Learning who to avoid?
<P>Absolutely.
<P>- Harry? - Sarah,
<P>switch off your phone and tell me exactly how long it is that you've been working here.
<P>Two years, seven months,
<P>three days and, I suppose, what, two hours?
<P>And how long have you been in love with Karl, our enigmatic chief designer?
<P>Um...
<P>Two years, seven months, three days and, I suppose, an hour and 30 minutes.
<P>Thought as much.

<P>- Do you think everybody knows? - Yes.
<P>- Do you think Karl knows? - Yes.
<P>Oh, that is... that is bad news.
<P>I just thought that maybe the time had come to do something about it.
<P>- Like what? - Invite him out for a drink
<P>then casually mention you'd like to marry him and have lots of sex and babies.
<P>- You know that? - Yes.
<P>And so does Karl.
<P>Think about it, for all our sakes.
<P>It's Christmas.
<P>Certainly. Excellent. Will do.
<P>Thanks, boss.
<P>- Hi, Sarah. - Hi, Karl.
<P>Babe. Absolutely, fire away.
<P>Mia, Mia, would you turn that down?
<P>What is that?
<P>That was the Christmas effort from the once great Billy Mack.

<P>Oh, dear me, how are the mighty fallen.
<P>I can safely say that is the worst record I've heard this century...
<P>Oh, and coincidentally, I believe Billy will be a guest
<P>on my friend Mike's show in a few minutes' time.
<P>Welcome back, Bill.
<P>Billy, welcome back to the airwaves.
<P>New Christmas single, cover of Love Is All Around.
<P>Except we've changed the word "love" to "Christmas".
<P>Yes, is that an important message to you, Bill?
<P> Not really, Mike.
<P>Christmas is a time for people with someone they love in their lives.
<P>- And that's not you? - That's not me, Michael.
<P>When I was young and successful, I was greedy and foolish
<P>and now I'm left with no one, wrinkled and alone.
<P>- Wow. Thanks for that, Bill. - For what?
<P>For actually giving a real answer to a question.

<P>It doesn't often happen here at Radio Watford, I can tell you.
<P>- Ask me anything, I'll tell you the truth. - Best shag you ever had?
<P>- Britney Spears. - Wow.
<P>No, only kidding!
<P>- She was rubbish. - OK, here's one.
<P>How do you think the new record compares to your old, classic stuff?
<P>Come on, Mikey, you know as well as I do the record's crap.
<P>But wouldn't it be great if number one this Christmas
<P>wasn't some smug teenager
<P>but an old ex-heroin addict searching for a comeback at any price?
<P>Those young popsters come Christmas will be stretched out naked
<P>with a cute bird balancing on their balls
<P>and I'll be stuck in some dingy flat with me manager Joe,
<P>ugliest man in the world,
<P>fucking miserable because our fucking gamble didn't pay off.
<P>So if you believe in Father Christmas, children, like your Uncle Billy does,
<P>buy my festering turd of a record.

<P>And particularly enjoy the incredible crassness
<P>of the moment we try to squeeze an extra syllable into the fourth line.
<P>I think you're referring to
<P>"If you really love Christmas..."
<P>"Come on and let it snow." Ouch.
<P>So, here it is one more time,
<P>the dark horse for this year's Christmas number one,
<P>Christmas Is All Around. Thank you, Billy. After this, the news.
<P>Is the new prime minister in trouble already?
<P>"I feel it in my fingers I feel it in my toes"
<P>- OK. What's next? - The President's visit.
<P>Ah, yes, yes. I fear this is going to be a difficult one to play. Alex.
<P>There's a strong feeling in the party we mustn't allow ourselves to be bullied
<P>- like the last government. - Here, here.
<P>This is our first really important test, let's take a stand.
<P>Right. Right. I understand that but I have decided...
<P>not to. Not this time.

<P>Let's not forget that America is the most powerful country in the world.
<P>I'm not going to act like a petulant child.
<P>Who do you have to screw round here to get a cup of tea and a biscuit?
<P>Right.
<P>Yeah, come in.
<P>- These are from the Treasury... - Uh-huh.
<P>...and these are for you.
<P>Excellent. Thanks a lot.
<P>I was hoping you'd win, not that I wouldn't have been nice to the other bloke,
<P>just always given him the boring biscuits with no chocolate.
<P>Thanks very much. Thanks...
<P>Natalie.
<P>God, come on, get a grip. You're the Prime Minister, for God's sake.
<P>So what do you reckon to our new prime minister?
<P>Oh, I like him. I can't understand why he's not married, though.
<P>You know the type, he's married to his job.
<P>Either that or gay as a picnic basket.

<P>Excuse me, Judy, if you could just lower the nipples
<P>- and cheat them a bit to the left? - OK.
<P>I have to say, Judy, this is a real pleasure,
<P>it's lovely to find someone I can actually chat to.
<P>- Thank you! - Oh, well, you know.
<P>- And ditto. - Thank you.
<P>The move again, please, Judy.
<P>- Ooh, sorry. - Oh, God, sorry. You all right?
<P>- Exciting news! - What?
<P>I've bought a ticket to the States. I'm off in three weeks.
<P>- No. - Yes!
<P>- To a fantastic place called Wisconsin. - No!
<P>Yes! Wisconsin babes, here comes Sir Colin!
<P>No, Col! There are a few babes in America, I grant you,
<P>but they're going out with rich, attractive guys.
<P>Tone, you're just jealous.
<P>You know perfectly well that any bar anywhere in America

<P>contains ten girls more beautiful and more likely to have sex with me
<P>- than the whole of the United Kingdom. - That is total bollocks. You're mad.
<P>No, I'm wise. Stateside I am Prince William without the weird family.
<P>- No, Colin, no! - Yes!
<P>- Nyet! - Da!
<P>- Nein! - Ja, darling!
<P>Right, the Christmas party, not my favourite night of the year
<P>and your unhappy job to organise.
<P>- Tell me. - It's basic, really.
<P>Find a venue, over-order on the drinks, bulk buy the guacamole
<P>and advise the girls to avoid Kevin if they want their breasts unfondled.
<P>- Wives and family and stuff? - Yeah. I mean, not children.
<P>But their wives and girlfriends, et cetera.
<P>Oh, Christ, you haven't got some horrible six-foot, tight-T-shirt-wearing boyfriend?
<P>No. I'll just be hanging around the mistletoe, hoping to be kissed.
<P>Really?
<P>Right.

<P>He now spends all the time in his room. I mean, he'll be up there now.
<P>- That's not unusual. My horrid son... - Bernard?
<P>Bernard. Stays in his room all the time. Thank goodness.
<P>Yeah, but Karen, this is all the time.
<P>I'm afraid that there's something really wrong, you know?
<P>I mean, clearly it's about his mum
<P>but Christ, he might be injecting heroin into his eyeballs for all I know.
<P> At the age of 11?
<P> Well, maybe not his eyeballs, then. Maybe just his veins.
<P>The problem is his mum always used to talk to him, you know, and...
<P>I don't know, this whole stepfather thing seems suddenly to somehow matter
<P>like it never did before.
<P>Listen, it was always going to be a totally shit time.
<P>Just be patient.
<P>And maybe check the room for needles.

<P>And then when he sometimes does come out, it's obvious he's been crying.
<P>It's just such a ridiculous waste.
<P>And now if it's going to ruin Sam's life as well...
<P>I just don't know.
<P>Get a grip.
<P>People hate sissies.
<P>No one's ever gonna shag you if you cry all the time.
<P>Yeah. Absolutely.
<P>Helpful.
<P>So, what's the problem, Samuel?
<P>Is it just Mum or is it something else, huh?
<P>Maybe school?
<P>Are you being bullied?
<P>Or is it something worse?
<P>Can you give me any clues at all?
<P>- You really want to know? - I really want to know.
<P>Even though you won't be able to help?

<P>Even if that's the case, yeah.
<P>OK. Well...
<P>truth is, actually...
<P>I'm in love.
<P>Sorry?
<P>I know I should be thinking about Mum and I am but I'm in love.
<P>I was before she died and there's nothing I can do about it.
<P>- Aren't you a bit young to be in love? - No.
<P>Ah, well. OK, well...
<P>I'm a little relieved.
<P>- Why? - Because I...
<P>thought it'd be something worse.
<P>Worse than the total agony of being in love?
<P>Er...
<P>No, you're right.
<P>Total agony.
<P>- Night, Sarah. - Night, Karl.

<P>Yeah, absolutely.
<P>Free as a bird. Fire away.
<P>Alone again.
<P>Naturally.
<P>- I'll deal with it. - Mm.
<P>- Ah. Natalie. - Sir.
<P>Thanks.
<P>Natalie.
<P>Erm, I'm starting to feel...
<P>uncomfortable about us working so closely every day
<P>and me knowing so little about you, it seems elitist and wrong.
<P>Well, there's not much to know.
<P>Well, erm, where do you live, for instance?
<P>Wandsworth. The dodgy end.
<P>- Ah, my sister lives in Wandsworth. - Oh.
<P>So which exactly is the dodgy end?
<P>At the end of the high street, Harris Street, near the Queen's Head.

<P>- Oh, yeah, yeah, that is dodgy. - Hm.
<P>Erm, and you live with your husband? Boyfriend?
<P>- Three illegitimate but charming children? - No.
<P>I've just split up with my boyfriend, so I'm back with my mum and dad for a while.
<P>- Ah. Sorry. - No, it's fine.
<P>I'm well shot of him.
<P>- He said I was getting fat. - I beg your pardon?
<P>He said no one'd fancy a girl with thighs the size of tree trunks.
<P>Not a nice guy, actually, in the end.
<P>No.
<P>You know, erm...
<P>being Prime Minister, I could just have him murdered.
<P>Thank you, sir. I'll think about it.
<P>Do. The SAS are absolutely charming.
<P>Ruthless, trained killers are just a phone call away.
<P>Oh, God.
<P>Did you have this kind of problem?

<P>Yeah, course you did, you saucy minx.
<P>So, let's go. We can definitely crack this.
<P>Remember, I was a kid once, too.
<P>So, come on, it's someone at school. Right?
<P>- Yeah. - Uh-huh. Good, good.
<P>And what does she, he, feel about you?
<P>SHE doesn't even know my name.
<P>And even if she did, she'd despise me.
<P>She's the coolest girl in school.
<P>And everyone worships her because she's heaven.
<P>Good. Good.
<P>Well,
<P>basically you're fucked, aren't you?
<P>Hi there and welcome back.
<P>So, three weeks till Christmas, looks like the real competition is gonna be Blue.
<P>I saw them on the show last week. They weren't very nice about my record.
<P>No. Little scamps.

<P>But very, very talented musicians.
<P>Yeah. I understand you've got a prize for our competition winners.
<P>Yes, I have, Ant or Dec.
<P>It's a personalised felt-tip pen.
<P>Oh, great.
<P>It's brilliant. It even writes on glass,
<P>so if you've got a framed picture, like, for instance, this one of Blue,
<P>you can just write on it.
<P> Er, a lot of kids watching, Billy.  Oh, yeah.
<P>Hiya, kids.
<P>Here's an important message from your Uncle Bill -
<P>don't buy drugs.
<P>Become a pop star and they give you them for free.
<P>And I do believe it's a commercial break. We'll see you soon. Bye-bye.
<P>"All I want for Christmas is you"
<P>- Look at him! Eurh! - Just a minute.

<P>Actually, they're not funny. They're art.
<P>OK, let's say, er, Thursday, my place.
<P>Great. I've got Juliet on the other line, she wants to ask you a favour.
<P>- OK, fine. - Thanks and, er, be nice.
<P>- I'm always nice. - 'You know what I mean, Marky, be friendly.'
<P>- I'm always... - 'Mark? '
<P>Hi. How was the honeymoon?
<P>It was great. Thanks for the gorgeous sendoff.
<P>- So, what can I do for you? - 'It's only a tiny favour.'
<P>I've just tried the wedding video and it's a disaster.
<P>- 'It's come out all blue and wibbly.' - I'm sorry.
<P>I remember you filming a lot and I wondered if I could look at it.
<P>To be honest, I didn't really...
<P>Please. All I want is one shot of me in a wedding dress that isn't turquoise.
<P>I'll have a look but I'm pretty sure I wiped it, so don't get any hopes up.
<P>- 'Must go.'
<P>Any progress with our matchmaking plans?

<P>No. I've done fuck-all and never will because he's too good for me.
<P>How true.
<P>- Stop.
<P>And of course, your mobile goes.
<P>Hello. Hi. How you doing?
<P>- So, how's the Christmas party going? - Good.
<P>Think I've found a venue.
<P>- What's it like? - Good. Good.
<P>It's an art gallery. Full of dark corners for doing dark deeds.
<P>Oh. Right.
<P>Good. Well, I suppose I should take a look at it or something.
<P>You should.
<P>Ah, bonjour, Eleonore.
<P>Bonjour, Monsieur Bennett. Welcome back.
<P>And this year you bring a lady guest?
<P>No. There's a change of situation. Just me.
<P>- Oh. Am I sad or not sad? - I think you're not surprised.

<P>- And you stay here till Christmas? - Yeah, yeah.
<P>Good. Well, I find you a perfect lady to clean the house.
<P>This is Aurelia.
<P>Ah.
<P>- Er, bonjour, Aurelia. - Bonjour.
<P> Er, je suis, er, tres heureux de vous avoir ici.
<P>Unfortunately, she cannot speak French, just like you.
<P>She's Portuguese.
<P> Ah, ah, buongiorno.
<P>Eusebio, er, er...
<P> Er, molto bueno...
<P>I think she's ten years too young to remember a footballer called Eusebio.
<P>And "molto bueno" is Spanish.
<P>Right.

<P>Anyway, it's nice to meet you and...
<P>Can you drive her home after her work?
<P>Oh, absolutely, yes. Con-Con grande, er, pl-plesura.
<P>Which is what? Turkish?
<P> Bello.
<P>Er, bella.
<P>Er, mon-montagno,
<P>arvarez...
<P>No, right. Silence is golden.
<P>As the Tremeloes said.
<P>Clever guys,
<P>although I think the original version was by Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons.
<P>Gr-great band.
<P>Oh, shut up.
<P> Mr President!

<P>- Over here, sir! - What will you be talking about?
<P>Mr President, welcome.
<P>It's a pleasure to meet you.
<P>Come through. I'm sorry your wife couldn't make it.
<P>So is she. Although she would have been kind of Ionely.
<P>Yes. Pathetic, isn't it?
<P>Just never been able to tie a girl down.
<P>Not sure that politics and dating go together.
<P>Really? I've never found that.
<P>Yeah, you're still sickeningly handsome, whereas I look like my Aunt Mildred.
<P>- Very jealous of your plane, by the way. - Thank you. We love that thing.
<P>Ah, Natalie. Hi.
<P>Morning, ma'am. How's your day so far?
<P>- Excellent.
<P> My goodness, that's a pretty little son of a bitch.
<P>Did you see those pipes?

<P>Yeah, she's terrific. At her job.
<P>No, absolutely not. We cannot and will not consult on that either.
<P>That is unexpected.
<P>Well, it shouldn't be.
<P>The last administration made it perfectly clear.
<P>We're being consistent with their policies.
<P>With all respect, they were bad policies.
<P>Thanks, Alex. I don't think we're making progress here.
<P>Let's, erm... move on, shall we?
<P>Well, now, that was an interesting day.
<P>Sorry if our line was firm but there's no point in tiptoeing around today,
<P>then just disappointing you for four years.
<P>I have plans and I plan to see them through.
<P>Absolutely. There is one final thing to look at.
<P>It's very close to my heart. Just give me a second.
<P>I'll give you anything you ask for.
<P>As long as it's not something I don't wanna give.

<P>Hi.
<P>Pathetic.
<P>It's great Scotch.
<P>I'II, erm... I'll be going, then.
<P>Er, Natalie,
<P>I hope to see much more of you as our countries work toward a better future.
<P>Thank you, sir.
<P>Er, yes, Peter.
<P>Mr President, has it been a good visit?
<P>Very satisfactory indeed.
<P>We got what we came for
<P>and our special relationship is still very special.
<P>Prime Minister?
<P>I love that word "relationship". Covers all manner of sins, doesn't it?
<P>I fear that this has become a bad relationship.
<P>A relationship based on the President taking what he wants
<P>and casually ignoring all those things that really matter to, erm...

<P>Britain.
<P>We may be a small country but we're a great one, too.
<P>The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles,
<P>- Sean Connery, Harry Potter.
<P>- David Beckham's right foot.
<P>David Beckham's left foot, come to that.
<P>And a friend who bullies us is no longer a friend.
<P>And since bullies only respond to strength, from now onward,
<P>I will be prepared to be much stronger.
<P>And the President should be prepared for that.
<P>Mr President!
<P>Joe.
<P>It's your sister on line four.
<P>All right. Er, yes, I'm very busy and important, how can I help you?
<P>Have you gone completely insane?
<P>- You can't always be sensible. - 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'
<P>- It's the Chancellor on the other line. - It isn't!

<P>- 'I'll call you back.' - No, you won't!
<P>The trouble with being the Prime Minister's sister is it puts your life into perspective.
<P>What did my brother do today? He fought for his country.
<P>What did I do? I made a papier-mache lobster head.
<P>What is this we're listening to?
<P>Joni Mitchell.
<P>I can't believe you still listen to Joni Mitchell.
<P>I love her and true love lasts a lifetime.
<P>Joni Mitchell is the woman who taught your cold English wife how to feel.
<P>Did she? Oh, well, that's good, I must write to her and say thanks.
<P>Which doll for Daisy's friend Emily?
<P>The one that looks like a transvestite or the one that looks like a dominatrix?
<P> 'It's almost enough to make you feel patriotic,
<P>'so here's one for our arse-kicking prime minister.
<P>'A golden oldie for a golden oldie.'
<P>"Hold me

<P>"I'll give you all that you need
<P>"Wrap your love around me
<P>"You're so excited I can feel you getting hotter
<P>"Oh baby
<P>"I'll take you down, I'll take you down
<P>"Where no one's ever gone before
<P>"And if you want more
<P>"If you want more, more, more
<P>"Jump for my love
<P>"Jump in
<P>"And feel my touch
<P>"Jump, if you wanna taste my kisses in the night then
<P>"Jump for my love
<P>"I'll take you down, I'll take you down
<P>"Where no one's ever gone"
<P>- Yeah, erm,
<P>Mary, can we move the Japanese ambassador to four o'clock tomorrow?

<P>- Certainly, sir. - Terrific. Thanks so much.
<P>Erm. Would you like the last, er...?
<P> Thank you very much but no.
<P>If you saw my sister, you'd understand why.
<P>That's all right, more for me.
<P>Just don't go eating it all yourself,
<P>you're getting chubbier every day.
<P>I'm very lucky I've got a constitution where I never put on weight.
<P>- Hello.
<P>Oop. Sorry.
<P>Hello?
<P>- Thank you. - Nao!
<P>- Eu peco imensa desculpa. - Oh, no. Hold on.
<P>- God, it's half the book. Oh, no. - Que desastre.
<P>Just leave them, please! They're not important.
<P>They're not worth it!

<P>Stop! Stop.
<P>Aa-ahh.
<P>It's all just rubbish.
<P>Just leave it.
<P>Oh, God, she's in.
<P>And now she'll think I'm a total spaz if I don't go in too.
<P> Fuck - it's cold!
<P>Fuck - it's freezing! Fuck!
<P> This stuff better be good.
<P>It's not worth it, this isn't bloody Shakespeare.
<P> I don't want to drown
<P>saving some shit my grandmother could have written.
<P>Just stop. Stop.
<P> What kind of idiot doesn't make copies?

<P>I really must do copies.
<P>There'd better not be eels in here.
<P> Try not to disturb the eels.
<P>Oh, what the hell is that?
<P>Thank you. Thank you so much.
<P>I know. I'll name one of the characters after you.
<P> Maybe you could name one of the characters after me.
<P>Or give me 50% of the profits.
<P>Or I could give you 5% of the profits.
<P> What kind of book is it?
<P>- Romance? - Yes.
<P>It's, erm...
<P>Ah, er...
<P> Thriller... crime...

<P> Sim.  Crime. Crime, murder.
<P> Frightening?
<P>Er, scary? Yes, sometimes scary.
<P>And, er, sometimes not. Mainly scary how bad the writing is.
<P>Mm.
<P> I'd better get back to work.
<P>- Ah. - Later you'll drive me home?
<P>Sure.
<P>It's my favourite time of day...
<P>driving you.
<P> It's the saddest part of my day, leaving you.
<P>Sorry.
<P> 'And coming up later this morning, it's this guy... '

<P>"There's no beginning, there'll be no end
<P>- " Cos on Christmas... - '... the bad grandad of rock'n'roll,
<P>'here at 10:30. Do not switch off.'
<P>Banoffee pie?
<P>No, thanks.
<P>Thank God. You would've broken my heart if you'd said yes.
<P>Right, well, lucky you.
<P>- Can I come in? - Er, yeah, well, I'm a bit busy...
<P>I was just passing and I thought we might check that video thing out.
<P>I thought I might be able to swap it for some pie
<P>or maybe Munchies?
<P>Actually, I was serious - I don't know where it is. I'll have a look tonight.
<P>Mark, can I say something?
<P>Yeah.
<P>I know you're Peter's best friend
<P>and I know you've never particularly warmed to me.
<P>Look, don't, don't argue.

<P>We've never got friendly.
<P>But I wanted to say, I hope that can change.
<P>I'm nice. I really am. Apart from my terrible taste in pie and...
<P>It would be great if we could be friends.
<P>Absolutely. Absolutely.
<P>Great.
<P>Doesn't mean we'll be able to find the video, though.
<P>I had a real search when you first called and couldn't find it so...
<P>This one says "Peter and Juliet's Wedding".
<P>Do you think we might be on the right track?
<P>Er, yeah, well... Wow. That-that could be it.
<P>- Do you mind if I...? - I've probably taped over it.
<P>Almost everything's episodes of West Wing.
<P>Oh.
<P>Oh, bingo.
<P>That's lovely.
<P>Well done, you.

<P>Oh, that's gorgeous.
<P>Thank you so much, Mark, this is exactly what I was hoping for.
<P>I look quite pretty.
<P>You've stayed rather close.
<P>They're all of me.
<P> Yeah. Yeah.
<P>Yes.
<P>But...
<P>you never talk to me.
<P>You always talk to Peter.
<P>You don't like me.
<P>I hope it's useful.
<P>Don't show it around too much.
<P>Needs a bit of editing.
<P>Look, I've got to get to a... lunch.
<P>Early lunch.

<P>You can just show yourself out, can't you?
<P>It's a... self-preservation thing, you see.
<P>"Oh I am what I am
<P>"I'll do what I want
<P>"But I can't hide
<P>"And I won't go
<P>"I won't sleep
<P>"And I can't breathe
<P>"Until you're resting here with me
<P>"And I won't leave
<P>"And I can't hide
<P>"I cannot be
<P>"Until you're resting here
<P>"And I won't go
<P>"And I won't sleep
<P>"And I can't breathe
<P>"Until you're resting here with me"

<P>- Yeah.
<P>Annie, my darling, my dream, my boat.
<P>Ah...
<P>- Need you to do a favour for me. - Of course.
<P>Anything for the hero of the hour.
<P>Don't ask me why, and don't read stuff into this,
<P>it's just a weird personality thing.
<P>But, erm, you know Natalie who works here?
<P>The chubby girl?
<P>Ooh, would we call her chubby?
<P>I think there's a pretty sizeable arse there, yes, sir. Huge thighs.
<P>Yeah. Well, whatever, erm...
<P>I'm sure she's a lovely girl but I wonder if you could, erm...
<P>redistribute her?
<P>It's done.
<P>Hey, Sammo. Can't sleep?
<P>I got some terrible news today.

<P>Let's have it.
<P>- Joanna's going back to America. - Your girl's American?
<P>Yes, she's American.
<P>And she's not my girl.
<P>And she's going back to America. That's the end of my life as I know it.
<P>That is bad news.
<P>Well, we need Kate
<P>and we need Leo, and we need them now.
<P>Come on.
<P>'Hold on. Hold on.
<P>'Keep your eyes closed.
<P>- 'Do you trust me? ' - 'I trust you.'
<P>- Do you trust me? - I trust you.
<P>- Fool! - Get off, you big bully.
<P>'AII right, open your eyes.'
<P>You know, Sammy, I'm sure she's unique and extraordinary
<P>but general wisdom is that in the end,

<P>there isn't just one person for each of us.
<P>There was for Kate and Leo.
<P>There was for you.
<P>And there is for me.
<P>She's the one.
<P>Fair enough. And her name's Joanna?
<P>Yeah, I know. Same as Mum.
<P>- Yeah.
<P>- Prime Minister. - Thank you very much.
<P>Oh. Appolo... Erm, appologia.
<P>Grande, er... grande familio, grande tradizione de Christmas presents.
<P>Stupido.
<P>Well, goodbye.
<P> Thank you.
<P>Erm, it was, erm...
<P> I will miss you.

<P>And your very slow typing...
<P>and your very bad driving.
<P>"You know I love Christmas, I always will
<P>"My mind's made up, the way that I feel
<P>"There's no beginning, there'll be no end
<P>"Cos on Christmas you can depend"
<P>Daniel!
<P>- I have a plan. - Thank the Lord. Tell me.
<P>- Well, girls love musicians, don't they? - Uh-huh.
<P>- Even the weird ones get girlfriends. - That's right.
<P>Meat Loaf definitely got laid at least once.
<P>For God's sake, Ringo Starr married a Bond girl.
<P>Whatever. There's this big concert at the end of term and Joanna's in it.
<P>I thought if I was in the band and played superbly,
<P>she might fall in love with me. What do you think?
<P>I think it's brilliant, I think it's stellar.
<P>Apart from the one obvious tiny little baby little hiccup.

<P>- I don't play a musical instrument? - Yes, sir.
<P>A tiny, insignificant detail.
<P>"You look into my eyes
<P>"I go out of my mind
<P>"I can't see anything
<P>"Cos this love's got me blind
<P>"I can't help myself
<P>"I can't break this spell
<P>"I can't even try
<P>"Baby, I'm too lost in you
<P>"Caught in you
<P>"Lost in everything about you
<P>"So deep I can't sleep, I can't..."
<P>I suppose I'd better do the duty round.
<P>You're a saint.
<P>Any chance of a dance with the boss?
<P>Yeah, sure, sure.

<P>As long as your boyfriend doesn't mind.
<P>Not my boyfriend.
<P>"And you're all I see
<P>"And you're all I need
<P>"Help me, baby "Help me, baby
<P>"Help me, baby
<P>"Oh baby, I'm too lost in you
<P>"Caught in you..."
<P>You're looking very pretty tonight.
<P>It's for you.
<P>Sorry?
<P>It's all for you, sir.
<P>"You do
<P>"I'm too lost in you "Baby, baby
<P>"Baby, I'm too lost in you "Yeah, yeah
<P>"Caught in you
<P>"Lost in everything about you

<P>"So deep I can't sleep"
<P>'This must be very exciting for you, fighting for the Christmas number one.
<P>- 'How's it looking so far? ' - 'Very bad indeed.
<P>'Blue are outselling me five to one
<P>'but I'm hoping for a late surge.
<P>'And, if I reach number one,
<P>'I promise to sing a song stark naked on TV on Christmas Eve.'
<P>- 'Do you mean that? ' - 'Of course I do, Michael.
<P>'Do you want a preview? You old flirt.'
<P>'That'll never make number one.'
<P>"And I burn every track Clipse and J Timberlake..."
<P>I suppose it's his job to dance with everyone, isn't it?
<P>Some more than others.
<P>Just one dance?
<P>- Before we run out of chances. - Who, me?
<P>- Unless you just... - No! No! Good.
<P>Yes. Thanks.

<P>"You're a good girl And that's what makes me trust you like I do
<P>"Late at night I talk to you
<P>"Hey
<P>"You will know the difference when..."
<P>"Like a flower
<P>"Waiting to bloom
<P>"Like a light bulb
<P>"In a dark room
<P>"I'm just sitting here
<P>"Waiting for you
<P>"To come on home
<P>"And turn me on
<P>"Like the desert
<P>"Waiting for the rain
<P>"Like a schoolkid
<P>"Waiting for the spring
<P>"I'm just sitting here

<P>"Waiting for you to come on home
<P>"And turn me on
<P>"Turn me on"
<P>Well, then. I'd better go.
<P>OK.
<P>- Good night. - Good night.
<P>Actually...
<P>- I don't have to go. - Right. Good.
<P>- I mean... - No, that's good.
<P>Just, erm, would you excuse me for one second?
<P>- Sure. - Just one second.
<P>m, OK, that's done. m...
<P>Why don't you come upstairs in about ten seconds?
<P>- Ten seconds. - Ten seconds.
<P>"For you
<P>"There'll be no crying
<P>"For you
<P>"The sun will be shining
<P>"Cos I feel that when I'm with you
<P>"It's all right..."
<P>- Just tug it. - OK.
<P>"I know it's right
<P>"And the songbirds
<P>"Keep singing like they know the score
<P>"And I love you, I love you, I love you..."

<P>You're beautiful.
<P>"Like never before..."
<P>l-I'd better answer that.
<P>Hello. Hi. Hello, darling.
<P>No, no, I'm not busy. No, fire away.
<P>Right.
<P>Yes, I... I'm not quite sure it's gonna be possible
<P>to get the Pope on the phone tonight but...
<P>Yes. Yes, I'm sure he's very good at exorcism but...
<P>Well, I'm sure...
<P>Jon Bon Jovi is as well and I'll definitely look into it.
<P>OK? OK, I'll talk to you later.
<P>All right, bye-bye.
<P>- Sorry about that. - No, it's fine.
<P>It's my brother, he's not well, he calls a lot.
<P>- I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. It's fine.
<P>I mean, it's not really fine, it is what it is,

<P>and there being no parents now and us being over here,
<P>it's my job to keep an eye on him. Not my job, obviously, I'm glad to do it...
<P>That's OK. Life is full of interruptions and complications.
<P>So...
<P>Will it make him better?
<P>No.
<P>Then maybe...
<P>don't answer.
<P>Hey. How you doing?
<P>Right, right. Oh, no, please.
<P>Oh, please, please don't, little darling.
<P>Between the two of us we'll find the answer and it won't hurt any more.
<P>No, no.
<P>I'm-I'm not busy. I...
<P>Of course, if you want me to come over I will. Mm-hm.
<P>OK.
<P>That was a good night.

<P>- Except I felt fat. - Don't be ridiculous.
<P>It's true.
<P>Nowadays the only clothes I can get into were once owned by Pavarotti.
<P>I always think Pavarotti dresses very well.
<P>Mia's very pretty.
<P>Is she?
<P>You know she is, darling.
<P>Be careful there.
<P>Have you been watching stuff on TV?
<P>Yeah.
<P>- Every night. - Good.
<P>And every day.
<P>- The nurses are trying to kill me. - Nobody's trying to kill you, babe.
<P>Thank you.
<P>Don't do that, my darling.
<P>Thank you.
<P>Don't do that.

<P>Right. Back at three. Christmas shopping, never easy or pleasant.
<P>Are you gonna get me something?
<P>Er...
<P>I don't know, I hadn't thought.
<P>Where's Sarah, by the way?
<P>She couldn't make it in. Family thing.
<P>There's a word for hangover I've never heard before.
<P>- See you later. - Yes. Looking forward to it.
<P>A lot.
<P>Are you gonna give me something?
<P>I thought I made it clear last night.
<P>When it comes to me, you can have everything.
<P>So, erm, what do you need?
<P>Something along the stationery line? Are you short of staplers?
<P>No. I don't want something I need.
<P>I want something I want. Something pretty.
<P>Right.

<P>Right.
<P>Sorry I'm late, I had to drop off Bernie at rehearsal.
<P>Right, listen, you keep yourself occupied
<P>while I do the boring stuff for our mothers.
<P>- Thank you. - Thank you.
<P>Looking for anything in particular, sir?
<P>Yes. That necklace there, how much is it?
<P>It's \xa3270.
<P>- Erm, all right. Er, I'll have it. - Lovely.
<P>Would you like it... giftwrapped?
<P>- Yes, all right. - Lovely.
<P>Let me just pop it in the box.
<P>There.
<P>- Look, could we be quite quick? - Certainly, sir.
<P>Ready in the flashiest of flashes.
<P>- There. - That's great.
<P>Not quite finished.

<P>- I don't need a bag, I'll put it in my pocket. - Oh, this isn't a bag, sir.
<P>- Really? - This is so much more than a bag.
<P>Ooh!
<P>Could we be quite quick, please?
<P>Prontissimo.
<P>- What's that? - A cinnamon stick, sir.
<P>- Actually, I really can't wait. - You won't regret it, sir.
<P>Want to bet?
<P>'Tis but the work of a moment.
<P>There we go. Almost finished.
<P>Are you gonna dip it in yogurt? Cover it with chocolate buttons?
<P>No, sir, we're going to pop it in the Christmas box.
<P>I don't want a Christmas box.
<P>- But you wanted it giftwrapped. - I did but...
<P>- The final flourish. - Can I pay?
<P>- All we need now... - Oh, God.
<P>...is a sprig of holly. - No, no, no, no.

<P>- No bloody holly. - But sir...
<P>- Leave it. - Ooh!
<P>- Loitering around the jewellery section? - No. I was just looking around.
<P>Don't worry. My expectations are not that high
<P>after 13 years of Mr Oh-But-You-Always-Love-Scarves.
<P>Actually, I do love this one.
<P>"I've gotta know
<P>"Where do the Ionely hearts go..."
<P>- Hey! - What are you doing here?
<P>Had to rent out my flat to pay for my ticket.
<P>You're not actually going ahead with this stupid plan?
<P>I bloody am.
<P>You think this is full of clothes? Like hell it is.
<P>It is chock-a-block full of condoms.
<P>Excellent. Excellent. Perfect, keep that going.
<P> Look, erm...

<P>sorry to be a bit forward and all that but...
<P>you don't fancy going for a Christmas drink, do you? I mean, nothing implied.
<P>Just maybe go and see something Christmassy or something.
<P>Obviously, if you don't want to, you don't have to. I...
<P>I'm rambling now, sorry.
<P>No. That would be lovely.
<P>Oh, great.
<P>Yay!
<P>You know, that is really great.
<P>Normally, I'm really shy, takes me ages to get the courage up, so thank you.
<P>- Explain again why you're so late. - Can't a man have any secrets?
<P>We've been waiting for hours, it's the first ever preview.
<P>"...is a thing of the past
<P>"Maybe you can bring us all hope this year
<P>"Visions of sugarplums have disappeared..."
<P> It was a starry night in ancient Jerusalem

<P>and the baby Jesus was in his manger.
<P>Sherlock Holmes is not a real detective.
<P> Is this the way to the train station?
<P>I would like half-pint of churly.
<P>I would like a one-day Travelcard.
<P> Oh, my God, I've got a terrible stomachache.
<P>It must have been the prawns.
<P>Milton Keynes has many roundabouts.
<P> My goodness, this is a very big fish!
<P>It tastes delicious!
<P>"All alone on Christmas
<P>"Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
<P>"All alone on Christmas "Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas
<P>"Tell me I've got to know

<P>"Nobody ought to be alone on Christmas "Don't leave me alone"
<P>- You'll come back a broken man. - Yeah, back broken from too much sex.
<P>You are on the road to disaster.
<P>No, I am on shag highway, heading west.
<P>Farewell, failure.
<P>America, watch out! Here comes Colin Frissell.
<P>"And he's got a big knob"
<P>- Take me to a bar. - What kind of bar?
<P>Just any bar. Just your average American bar.
<P> " Man, it's a hot one
<P>"Like seven inches from the midday sun..."
<P>- Can I help you? - Yes. I'd like a Budweiser, please.
<P>- King of beers. - Bud coming up.
<P>Oh, my God.
<P>Are you from England?
<P>- Yes. - Oh...

<P>that is so cute.
<P>Hi, I'm Stacey.
<P>Jeannie?
<P>Yeah?
<P>- This is... - Colin.
<P>Frissell.
<P>Cute name.
<P>- Jeannie. - He's from England.
<P>Yep. Basildon.
<P>- Oh. - Oh.
<P>Wait till Carol-Anne gets here. She's crazy about English guys.
<P> Uh-huh.
<P>- Hey, girls. - Carol-Anne, come meet Colin.
<P>He's from England.
<P>Well, step aside, ladies. This one's on me.
<P>- Hey, gorgeous.

<P>That is so funny!
<P>- What do you call that? - Er, bottle.
<P> "Bottle."
<P>- What about this? - Er, straw.
<P> "Straw."
<P>- What about this? - Table.
<P>- Table. The same. - Oh, it's the same.
<P>- Where are you staying? - I don't actually know.
<P>I'll just check into a motel like in the movies.
<P>Oh, my God. Oh, my God, that is so cute.
<P>No, no, no, listen. This may be a bit pushy cos we just met you but...
<P>why don't you come back and sleep at our place?
<P>- Yeah. - Yeah.
<P>Well, if it's not too much of an inconvenience.
<P>- Hell no! - But there's one problem.

<P>What?
<P>Well, we're not the richest of girls, you know.
<P>So we just have a little bed and no couch.
<P>So you'd have to share with all three of us.
<P>And on this cold, cold night it's gonna be crowded and sweaty and stuff.
<P>And we can't even afford pyjamas.
<P>No?
<P>Which means...
<P>we would be naked.
<P>No, no, I think it'd be fine.
<P>- Great. - Erm...
<P>The thing that's gonna make it more crowded...
<P>Harriet. You haven't met Harriet.
<P>- There's a fourth? - Yeah.
<P>Don't worry, you're totally gonna like her cos she is "the sexy one".
<P>- Really? Wow. - Yeah.
<P>- Praise the Lord! - Oh, and he's a Christian.

<P> Cheers.
<P>"If I could
<P>"Then I would
<P>"I'll go wherever you will go
<P>"Way up high
<P>"Or down low
<P>"I'll go wherever you will go
<P>"If I could turn back..."
<P>One present only each tonight. Who's got one for Dad?
<P>- I have. - Let Mummy go first.
<P>- I'll get it. - No, no, no. I want to choose mine.
<P>I think I want...
<P>...this one. - I have bought the traditional scarf as well
<P>but this is my other, slightly special, personal one.
<P>Thank you.
<P>That's a real first.

<P>- Rip it! - What is it?
<P>I'm going to... All right, I'll rip it.
<P>God, that's a surprise.
<P> What is it?
<P>It's a CD. Joni Mitchell, wow.
<P>To continue your emotional education.
<P>Yes.
<P>Goodness.
<P>That's great.
<P>- My brilliant wife. - Ah, yes.
<P>Actually, do you mind if I just absent myself for a second?
<P>All that ice cream. Er...
<P>Darling, could you make sure the kids are ready to go?
<P>- Back in a minute. - All right, take it easy.
<P> Mine first. Mine.

<P>"Moons and Junes
<P>"And Ferris wheels
<P>"The dizzy dancing way that you feel
<P>"As every fairy tale comes real
<P>"I've looked at love that way
<P>"But now it's just another show
<P>"And you leave 'em laughing when you go
<P>"And if you care
<P>"Don't let them know
<P>"Don't give yourself away
<P>"I've looked at love
<P>"From both sides now
<P>"From give and take
<P>"And still somehow
<P>"It's love's illusions that I recall
<P>"I really don't know love
<P>"I really don't know love at all

<P>"Tears and fears
<P>"And feeling proud
<P>"To say I love you right out loud
<P>"Dreams and schemes
<P>"And circus crowds
<P>"I've looked at life that way
<P>"Oh but now old friends..."
<P>Oh, my God.
<P>It's a miracle. You're all dressed.
<P>Come on, come on, come on, we're horribly late.
<P>Come on, then. In the car. In the car.
<P>"Well something's lost
<P>"But something's gained
<P>"In living every day"
<P>- Has she noticed you yet? - No.
<P>But the thing about romance is people only get together right at the very end.
<P>Of course.

<P>By the way, I feel bad. I never ask you how your love life is going.
<P>Er-huh!
<P>No.
<P>As you know, that was a done deal long ago.
<P>Unless Claudia Schiffer calls, in which case I want you out of here straightaway,
<P>- you wee motherless mongrel. - Oh!
<P>No, no. We'll want to have sex in every room, including yours.
<P>'It's a rainy Christmas Eve all over the UK
<P>'and the question is who is number one on the Radio One chart show tonight?
<P>'Is it Blue or the unexpected Christmas sensation from Billy Mack?
<P>'You might have guessed it although you may not believe it.
<P>'It's Billy Mack.'
<P>- You are the champion! - Shh.
<P>- 'Hi, Billy.' - Hello.
<P>'We're live across the nation and you're number one.
<P>- 'How will you be celebrating? ' - I don't know.
<P>Er, either I could behave like a real rock'n'roll loser

<P>and get drunk with my fat manager...
<P>or, when I hang up,
<P>I'll be flooded by invitations to a large number of glamorous parties.
<P>'Let's hope it's the latter. Here it is. Number one, from Billy Mack,
<P>- 'it's Christmas Is All Around.' - Oh, Jesus, not that crap again.
<P>"I feel it in my fingers..."
<P>Bill, it's for you, babe.
<P>Hello. Elton.
<P>O-Of course. Of course.
<P>Send an embarrassingly big car and I'll be there.
<P>It's gonna be a very good Christmas.
<P>- Right. - I'd better be getting inside, actually.
<P>- My mum and... you know. - Of course, yeah. It's getting a bit cold.
<P>Erm...
<P>- Well, good night. - Night.
<P>Er...
<P>Er... OK.

<P>All I want for Christmas...
<P>- is you.
<P>Right.
<P>Thank you. Good.
<P>Good night.
<P>Ha ha ha! Ho.
<P>"I'm, I'm dreaming
<P>"Dreaming of a white..."
<P>Oh, look, everyone, it's Uncle Jamie.
<P>Hi, Uncle Jamie!
<P>Yes, oh, splendid. It's lovely to see you all.
<P>And, er...
<P>I'm off, actually.
<P>But Jamie, darling.
<P>Sorry.
<P>Man's gotta do what a man's gotta do.
<P>I hate Uncle Jamie!

<P> I hate Uncle Jamie.  I hate Uncle Jamie.
<P>"And try to listen
<P>"To hear
<P>"Hear for the sleigh bells
<P>"That are ringing in the snow..."
<P>Gatwick airport, please. Fast as you can.
<P>"l-l-I
<P>"I'm dreaming
<P>"Of a white..."
<P>- Night, Sarah. - Night, Karl.
<P>I, er...
<P>- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas.
<P>"I want you to know, may your day
<P>"May your day
<P>"Be so merry, merry and bright..."
<P>Hi, babe, how's it going? Yeah.

<P>Is it all party, party, party down there?
<P>"All of your Christmases
<P>"And may all
<P>"And may all of your Christmases
<P>"Baby may your days
<P>"May your days be merry
<P>"Merry, so merry..."
<P>- Sam, time for dinner. - I'm not hungry.
<P>Sam, I've done chicken kebabs.
<P> Look at the sign on the door.
<P>Right.
<P>It's a little long.
<P>"Dreaming, dreaming of a white, white Christmas..."
<P>I'll get it.
<P>- Oh, hi. - Who is it?
<P>It's carol singers.

<P>Give them a quid and tell them to bugger off.
<P>"Silent night
<P>"Holy night
<P>"All is calm
<P>"All is bright
<P>"Round yon virgin
<P>"Mother and child
<P>"Holy infant
<P>"So tender and mild
<P>"Sleep in heavenly peace
<P>"Sleep in heavenly peace
<P>"Silent night
<P>"Holy night
<P>"Shepherds quake
<P>"At the sight..."
<P> Merry Christmas.

<P>"Glories stream
<P>"From heaven afar
<P>"Heavenly hosts sing alleluia
<P>"Christ the saviour is born
<P>"Christ the saviour is born"
<P>Enough.
<P>Enough now.
<P>What the hell are you doing here? You're supposed to be at Elton John's.
<P>Well, I was there for a minute or two and then I had an epiphany.
<P>- Really? - Yeah.
<P>Come on. Just come up.
<P>So what was this epiphany?
<P>Erm, it... it was about Christmas.
<P>You realised it was all around.
<P>No. I realised that Christmas is the time to be with the people you love.
<P>Right.
<P>And I realised that, as dire chance and fateful cockup would have it,

<P>here I am,
<P>mid-fifties,
<P>and without knowing it, I've spent most of my adult life
<P>with a chubby employee.
<P>And, much as it grieves me to say it,
<P>it might be that the people I love is, in fact...
<P>you.
<P>Well, this is a surprise.
<P>Yeah.
<P>Ten minutes at Elton John's and you're gay?
<P>No, look. I'm serious here.
<P>I left Elton's and a hefty number of half-naked chicks with their mouths open
<P>in order to hang out with you at Christmas.
<P>- Well, Bill... - It's a terrible, terrible mistake, chubs...
<P>but you turn out to be the fucking love of my life.
<P>And to be honest, despite all my complaining...
<P>we have had a wonderful life.

<P>Well...
<P>thank you.
<P>I mean, come on, it's been an honour.
<P>I feel very proud.
<P>Oh, look, don't be a moron.
<P>Come on, let's get pissed and watch porn.
<P> 'Dear sir, Dear David,
<P>'Merry Christmas and I hope you have a very happy New Year.
<P>'I'm very sorry about the thing that happened.
<P>'It was a very odd moment and I feel like a prize idiot.
<P>'Particularly because -
<P>'if you can't say it at Christmas, when can you, eh? -
<P>'I'm actually yours. With love, your Natalie.'
<P>Jack, yeah, I need a car.
<P>Right now. Thank you.
<P>Oh, don't wait up.

<P>I'd like to go to Wandsworth, the dodgy end.
<P>Very good, sir.
<P>"Tell me how you want me
<P>"I can feel it in your heart beat
<P>"I know you like what you see..."
<P> Harris Street. What number, sir?
<P> Oh, God, it's the longest street in the world and I have absolutely no idea.
<P>"Wrap your love around me
<P>"You're so excited I can feel you getting hotter"
<P>Hello, does Natalie live here?
<P>- No. - Right, fine, thank you. Sorry to disturb.
<P>Here, aren't...
<P>Aren't you the Prime Minister?
<P>- Er, yes. In fact, I am. Merry Christmas. - Oh.
<P>Part of the service now. Trying to get round everyone by New Year's Eve.

<P>Ah. Hello. Does Natalie live here?
<P>- No, she doesn't. - Oh dear. OK.
<P>- Are you singing carols? - Er, no. No, I'm not.
<P>- Please, sir, please. - Please.
<P>Well, I suppose I could.
<P>Please.
<P>- All right.
<P>"Good King Wenceslas looked out
<P>"On the feast of Stephen
<P>"When the snow lay round about
<P>"Deep and crisp and even
<P>"Brightly shone the moon that night"
<P>- Hello. Sorry to disturb.
<P>- Does Natalie live here? - No.
<P>She lives next door.
<P>Ah. Brilliant.
<P>You're not who I think you are, are you?

<P>Yes and I'm sorry about all the cockups.
<P>My cabinet are absolute crap. We hope to do better next year.
<P>Merry Christmas to you.
<P>- Ah. Hello.
<P>Is, er, Natalie in?
<P>Oh, where the fuck is my fucking coat?
<P>- Oh. Hello. - Hello.
<P>Erm, this is my mum and my dad and my Uncle Tony and my Auntie Glynne.
<P>- Hello. - Very nice to meet you.
<P>And, erm... this is the Prime Minister.
<P>Yes, we can see that, darling.
<P>And erm, unfortunately, we're very late.
<P>It's the school Christmas concert, you see, David.
<P>All the local schools have joined together, even St Basil's...
<P>- Too much detail, Mum. - Anyway, how can we help, sir?
<P>Well, I... just needed Natalie...
<P>on some state business.

<P>- Oh. - Right, yes. Of course.
<P>Right, er...
<P>Well, perhaps you should come on later, Plumpy.
<P>Er, Natalie.
<P>I don't want to make you late for the concert.
<P>- No, it's nothing, really. - Keith'll be very disappointed.
<P>- No, really, it doesn't matter. - The octopus costume's taken me months.
<P>Eight is a lot of legs, David.
<P>Mm. Erm...
<P>Listen, why don't I give you a lift
<P>and then we can talk about this state business business in the car.
<P>OK.
<P>- Lovely, yes. - Thank you.
<P>Hold tight, everybody.
<P>- How far is this place? - Just round the corner.
<P>Ah, right. Well, er...
<P>I just wanted to say...

<P>thank you for the Christmas card.
<P>You're welcome.
<P>Look, I'm so sorry about that day.
<P>I came in and he slinked towards me and there was a fire
<P>and he's the President of the United States and nothing happened, I promise.
<P>I just felt like such a fool because...
<P>I think about you all the time, actually.
<P>- And I think you're the man that I really... - We're here.
<P>...Iove. - Oh, wow.
<P>That really was just round the corner. Er...
<P>Erm...
<P>Ow!
<P>Well, look, I...
<P>I think I'd better not come in, you know?
<P>Nobody wants some politician stealing the kids' thunder.
<P>No, please come. It'll be great.
<P>No, I'd... I'd better not.

<P>But I will be very sorry
<P>to drive away from you.
<P>Just give me one second.
<P>John's been very mysterious. Where did you two meet?
<P>- Erm... erm... - Um... um...
<P>No!
<P>Come on in. We can watch from backstage.
<P>OK. Terry, I won't be long.
<P>Look, this has to be a very secret visit, OK?
<P>Don't worry. This was my school. I know my way around. Come on.
<P>Look, the sheep are ready already and you're not even...
<P>- Oh, David. - Ah!
<P>Oh, how are you?
<P>Hi, guys. Hey, hey, hey. You all right?
<P>What the hell are you doing here?
<P>- Well, you know... - We always tell your secretary
<P>that these things are going on but it never occurred to me you'd actually turn up.

<P>I thought it was time I did.
<P>I didn't want anyone to see, so I'm gonna hide somewhere.
<P>Good luck, Daisy, good luck, Bernie.
<P>I've never been gladder to see my stupid big brother.
<P>- Thank you. - All right.
<P>Oh, now. We haven't been introduced.
<P>Right. Well, this is Gavin.
<P>- Hello, Gavin. - My copper.
<P>And this is Natalie, who's my, erm...
<P>- who's my, erm, catering manager. - Oh.
<P>- Hi. - Catering manager.
<P>Watch he keeps his hands off you.
<P>20 years ago, you'd have been his type.
<P>I'll be very careful. Don't try something, sir, just because it's Christmas.
<P>- No, seriously.
<P>Come on. Showtime. Quickly.
<P>- Look, see you after, yeah? - Probably.

<P>- Thank you, Prime Minister. - It's all right.
<P>- Come on. - Right.

<P>Little bow.
<P>And a wave.
<P>Absolutely no idea. I mean, can you imagine?
<P>I'll see you later, all right?
<P>I'll speak to you. Bye.
<P>Tell me, if you were in my position, what would you do?
<P>What position is that?
<P>Imagine your husband bought a gold necklace
<P>and, come Christmas, gave it to somebody else.
<P>- Oh, Karen... - Would you wait around to find out...

<P>- Good night. - Night, darling. Happy Christmas.
<P>Would you wait around to find out if it's just a necklace
<P>or if it's sex and a necklace
<P>or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and love?
<P>Would you stay? Knowing life would always be a little bit worse?
<P>- Or would you cut and run? - Oh, God.
<P>I am so in the wrong.
<P>A classic fool.
<P>Yes, but you've also made a fool out of me.
<P>You've made the life I lead foolish, too.
<P>Darling. Ooh, darlings!
<P>Oh, you were wonderful.
<P>My little lobster, you were so...
<P>What is that word?
<P>Orange.
<P>Come on, I've got treats at home. Dad's coming.
<P>Sammy! Fantastic show! Classic drumming, son.

<P>- Thanks. Plan didn't work, though. - Tell her, then.
<P>- Tell her what? - That you love her.
<P>No way. Anyway, they fly tonight.
<P>Even better. Sam, you've got nothing to lose and you'll always regret it if you don't.
<P>I never told your mum enough.
<P>I should have told her every day because she was perfect every day.
<P>You've seen the films, kiddo. It ain't over till it's over.
<P>OK, Dad. Let's do it. Let's go get the shit kicked out of us by love.
<P>Yes.
<P>- Just give me one sec. - Yeah.
<P>- Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry.
<P>That's OK.
<P>- My fault. - No, no, really, it wasn't.
<P>You're Sam's dad, aren't you?
<P>Yeah. Stepdad, actually.
<P>- Daniel. - I'm Carol.
<P>Carol.

<P>- OK, I'm back. Let's go. - Yeah. Well...
<P>I hope we'll meet again, Karen.
<P>Carol.
<P>- I'll make sure we do. - Yeah? Good.
<P>- Tell her. - What?
<P>- You know... - Don't be such an arse.
<P>- Look, there she is. - Where?
<P>Over there.
<P>Oh, no.
<P>It's OK, we'll go to the airport. I know a short cut.
<P> Good evening.
<P>- Senhor Barros? - Sim.
<P>I am here to ask your daughter
<P>for her hands in marriage.
<P>You want to marry my daughter?
<P>Yes.

<P>Come here,
<P>there is a man at the door.
<P>He wants to marry you.
<P>But I've never seen him before.
<P>Who cares?
<P>You're going to sell me to a complete stranger?
<P>Sell? Who said sell? I'll pay him.
<P>Pardon me. I'm meaning your other daughter - Aurelia.
<P>She's not here - she's at work. I'll take you.
<P>You! Stay here.
<P>As if I would. Stupid!
<P>Father is about to sell Aurelia as a slave to this Englishman.
<P>Wait. Wait.
<P>Oh, no.
<P>You better not say yes, Father.
<P>Shut up, Miss Dunkin' Donut 2003.
<P>- Look, we're not actually flying. - You can't come through.

<P>Not even to let the boy say goodbye to the love of his life?
<P>No.
<P>- I'm sorry, Sam. - Boarding pass, sir?
<P>Just a moment, I know I've got it. Would you hang on to that?
<P>- Unless... - What?
<P>- Do you want to make a run for it? - Hold on to that.
<P>- You think I should? - Yeah.
<P>- OK. - Yes!
<P>I must have left them where I was having a cup of coffee.
<P>Apparently he is going to kill Aurelia.
<P>Cool!
<P>Joanna.
<P>Sam?
<P>- I thought you didn't know my name. - Course I do.
<P>Oh, Jesus. Here, I've gotta run.
<P>- Where is Aurelia? - Why should I tell you?
<P>This man wants to marry her.

<P>He can't do that - she's our best waitress.
<P>Boa noite, Aurelia.
<P>Boa noite, Jamie.
<P>Beautiful Aurelia...
<P>I've come here with a view to asking you...
<P>to marriage me.
<P>I know I seems an insane person because I hardly knows you
<P>but sometimes things are so transparency,
<P>they don't need evidential proof.
<P>And I will inhabit here, or you can inhabit with me in England.
<P>Definitely go for England, girl.
<P>You'll meet Prince William - then you can marry him instead.
<P>Of course I don't expecting you to be as foolish as me,
<P>and of course I prediction you say no...
<P>but it's Christmas and I just wanted to... check.
<P>Oh, God - say yes, you skinny moron.
<P> Thank you.

<P>That will be nice.
<P>Yes is being my answer.
<P>Easy question.
<P> What did you say?
<P>Yes, of course.
<P>Bravo!
<P> You learned English?
<P>Just in cases.
<P>"I may not always love you
<P>"But long as there are stars above you..."
<P>Hello, Daisy.
<P>- This one's Greta. - Hello, Greta.
<P>"I'll make you so sure about it..."
<P>Here she is. This is Aurelia. This is Juliet. This is Peter.
<P>- Mark, didn't see you there. - Just thought I'd tag along.

<P>Jamie's friends are so good-Iooking.
<P>He never tells me this.
<P>I think maybe now I have made the wrong choice,
<P>picked wrong Englishman.
<P>She can't speak English properly.
<P> Dad! Dad!
<P>Oh, God.
<P>- Did you get us any presents? - Matter of fact, I did.
<P> Thanks, Dad.
<P>- How are you? - I'm fine. I'm fine.
<P>Good to have you back.
<P>Come on. Home.
<P>There she is.
<P>- Hi. - Hello.
<P>- Aw, he should have kissed her. - No, that's cool.

<P>- All right? - Hey. What are you two doing here?
<P>- I might get a shag at last. - Naughty.
<P>- Got to go. - Bye.
<P>Yahoo!
<P>Now, this is Harriet.
<P>- Hi. Really pleased to meet you. - Hello, Harriet.
<P>I hope you don't mind, I sort of brought my sister to stay.
<P>This is Carla. She's real friendly.
<P>Hello, you must be Tony.
<P>I heard you were gorgeous.
<P>"God only knows what I'd be without you..."
<P>"God only knows what I'd be without you
<P>"God only knows what I'd be without you..."
<P>- God, you weigh a lot. - Oh, shut your face.
